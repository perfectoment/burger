# Burger Eater

I created an application that allows you to enter the name of any burger you would like to eat. That burger then appears in the burger container, ready to eat! When you are ready to devour the burger, just click the button and the burger moves into the new devoured list forever, so that you can always look fondly upon your burger memories.
